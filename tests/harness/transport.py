            every result carries it — including the error-path results whose

            this field. ``None`` only on a ``TransportResult`` constructed
            directly in a test rather than via ``call_via``.
        envelope: Transport-specific metadata (HTTP status, ToolResult, etc.).
        error: Exception raised during dispatch, if any.
        raw_response: Unprocessed transport response (httpx.Response, ToolResult, etc.).
        wire_response: Serialized success-path response body as a dict, captured
            from the real wire (REST HTTP JSON body, MCP structured_content, A2A
            artifact DataPart). ``None`` on error and on IMPL (no wire — serialize
            the typed ``payload`` instead). Lets success-path tests assert the
            actual serialized shape (e.g. the v3.1 format_id federation contract).
        wire_error_envelope: Raw two-layer error envelope dict captured from
            the actual wire bytes (REST HTTP body, MCP ToolError content text,
            A2A failed-Task artifact DataPart). ``None`` on success or on the

            for error verification — see ``tests/CLAUDE.md`` § Error
            Verification Policy.
        synthesized_error_envelope: Two-layer envelope produced by
            ``build_two_layer_error_envelope`` against the IMPL-caught
            ``AdCPError`` — what production WOULD emit at the boundary.
            ``None`` on success and on REST/MCP/A2A (those expose the real
            wire envelope above instead). Tests asserting on this field
            verify the envelope-builder contract, NOT the wire shape — a
